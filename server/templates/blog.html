				      				As of now, I have finished a lot of the structure for creating tests.
				      				I have created a utility for using the canvas tag to manipulate objects
				      				based on touch input. A system is also configured to run tasks once 
				      				a touch as been initiated, moved, and ended. 
				      			</p>
				      			<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">
				      				A test has now been crafted in which two balls move randomly around the screen
				      				and it is the goal of the subject to keep one finger in each circle. The
				      				application records how long each circle was occupied shows a modal displaying
				      				in a table the time, and the percentage of time that each of the circles
				      				was filled. There is also a modal that is displayed when the page is started
				      				outlining how the test should be conducted. The test is started once the 
				      				subject presses okay on the modal and puts their fingers inside the circles.

				      				<ul>
				      					<li>
				      						Collect a distance metric to see how far the fingers were
				      						from the correct circles
				      					</li>
				      					<li>
				      						Check which transitions are difficult for the subject to
				      						follow
				      					</li>
				      					<li>Implement the submit button to actually send data on the modal</li>
				      					<li>Make the balls never cross over themselves about the y-axis</li>

				      					<li>Allow entry of new information on the server side</li>
				      					<li>
				      						Create a structure that allows for transitions between tests

				      								<b>Update</b>: will use separate html pages to encourage

				      					</li>
				      					<li>
				      						Add a balance test that asks the subject to match the pitch of a
				      						a previously played sound by balancing on one foot and moving the
				      						tablet side to side
				      					</li>
				      				</ul>

				      				The main contributions today involved adding a form that a subject will 
				      				fill before the test begins. This data is saved temporarily using cookies. 
				      				Once the subject finishes the test, the data stored in the cookies along with
				      				the results are sent to the server and inserted into a RethinkDB database. 
				      				I have also included modals that notify the user of the instructions, tell 
				      				the user how they have done on the tests, and thank the user for using the 
				      				application. 
				      			</p>
				      			<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">
				      				More on the database side of things. The database's secondary index is 
				      				the email address. This should be unique so the indexing is not really 
				      				a problem I think. Perhaps I should make better login system... Using 
				      				email as the secondary index, I check if the email has been used before.
				      				If so, the results list is appended. If not, a new entry is inserted
				      				into the table. This allows people to do the test multiple times. Also, 
				      				the results list is flexible to have new tests (Thanks to RethinkDB).

						      				New tests
						      				<ul>
						      					<li>
						      						A test where user is shown a sequence of shapes and is asked
						      						to draw one of the shapes from the sequence. For instance, a
						      						subject is shown in order a square, a triangle, an octagon,
						      						and a circle. The user will be the prompted to draw the 3rd
						      						shape from that sequence. The subject should draw the octagon.
						      						Likewise, other questions could be asked such as draw the shape
						      						shown that had the least number of sides. 
						      					</li>
						      					<li>
						      						Adding on to the test described above, I could combine cognitive
						      						and balance testing by having the user draw the shape using
						      						tilt registered by the tablet.
						      					</li>
						      					<li>
						      						Arda suggested that I create a test that has a series of lines
						      						(or dots, not sure yet), and the subject is prompted to connect 
						      						the dots. This test will see how coodinated the subject is. The 
						      						metric being evaluated will measure how close to the actual line
						      						the drawn line is and how fast the dots were connected. 
						      					</li>
						      					<li>
						      						Perhaps the pitch matching game (boring as well)
						      					</li>
						      					<li>
						      						The generic test that a user has to tilt the tablet to get
						      						a ball through a maze (I dont really wanna do this one)
						      					</li>
						      				</ul>
						      			</li>
				      					<li>
				      						Transition between tests using separate html pages. Add a href to the
				      						button on the modal that takes the current view to the next page
				      					</li>
				      				</ul>
